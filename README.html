<h1>Chat Server</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>In this project, youâ€™ll create a chat <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server">server</a> with Socket.IO that enables multiple users to send and receive messages in realtime. You&rsquo;ll connect the chat server to the <a href="chat-ui.md">chat UI</a> you created in the previous project.</p>

<p>This project will give you experience with Node.js, Socket.IO, and jQuery.</p>

<h2>Useage</h2>

<p>Users are able to send messages back and forth by filling out the first input box and hitting enter. They may do so anonymously or create their own username by clicking on the &lsquo;edit&rsquo; text at the bottom of the page and making it work that way.</p>

<h2>Development</h2>

<p>Well that was easy, I followed a tutorial on socket.io on how to make a simple chat server. Once complete I just modified that code to work with my interface, Changed some functions added a bit more logic.</p>

<p>Next I wanted to put this up online, so i poped up a new droplet on DO and updated my DNS to allow for the subdomain of <a href="http://chat.coffy.tips">chat.coffy.tips</a>&hellip; so thats a thing now.</p>

<p>So to go for stretch goals.I had a whole chat with a friend of mine back in ontario and she suggested an interesting idea. Make an RPG chat system. For a system like this it would require.</p>

<ol>
<li>Persistant Chat</li>
<li>multi chat rooms</li>
<li>Know who the chats are coming from</li>
<li>make rooms or match making</li>
</ol>


<p>I think these 4 goals can keep me busy for next few days. I&rsquo;m probably going to trash the UI for something new to go along with added functionality.</p>

<p>Allons-y!</p>
